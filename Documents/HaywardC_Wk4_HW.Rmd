##Case Study: Book displays at Flourish and Blotts
####Prepared by Cynthia Hayward

The manager of Flourish and Blotts bookstore is trying to decide the best ways to arrange the book displays for the upcoming summer season in order to increase sales. We have been given a large data set with 90,000+ historical sales transactions. Using frequency pattern analysis, we will answer the following questions:

1.	What are the best-selling titles? 
2.	Which books should be included when creatng a book display to appeal to readers belonging     to book clubs? Click the followng link to access the printable list of Oprah's book club:     (https://static.oprah.com/images/o2/201608/201608-obc-complete-list-01a.pdf). 
3.	We will recommend other books that he should include in other display cases.
4.	The book entitled â€œWild Animus" is an interesting publishing story.  Literarily, it is       not significant--but is evidence of what an ego and too much money can do.  The link         leads to an interesting blog entry on the book:

###Inspecting the Transaction Data

We will begin our study by inspecting the first five transaction records.  
  
```{r}
inspect(bookbaskets[1:5]) #Examine the first five transactions
```
Next, it will be helpful to calculate the number of books purchased by user: We'll call them baskets.  Interestingly, purchases for some users is quite high.  One user has over 10,000 transactions!  In order for our pattern analysis to have meaning, we will limit our basket sizes.  To determine where to cut off, let's plot the values to take a look.

```{r}
basketSizes<-size(bookbaskets) #Calculate number of books purchased by "userID"
#summary(basketSizes[1:20])

plot(basketSizes, col = "red", ylab = "Size", xlab = "Transaction ID", main = "Basket Sizes")
```
```{r}
bookbasket_use<-bookbaskets[basketSizes>1 & basketSizes<500] #Limiting to only baskets with more than one book purchased and less than 500. 

#summary(bookbasket_use)
```
#####Basket Size

It appears that most of the baskets are around 500 or less.  We will include baskets which have more than one book and less than 500 books.
```{r}
book_freq_data_frame <- as.data.frame(itemFrequency(bookbasket_use))#this will provide a frequency--putting it in a data frame is helpful!

#View(book_freq_data_frame)
```

###Which Books are Most Popular? Why is that book Wild Animus in the List?

One of our goals was to determine the books which have sold the most.  Using all of the transaction data, we have determined the following books to be in our "Top Twenty"  The manager mentioned that the book Wild Animus had a very strange story.  We did the research, and it seemed that most books were given away.  From our transaction data, Flourish and Blotts sold almost 2000 copies of Wild Animus.  Very interesting revelation!

```{r}
#itemFrequency(bookbaskets[, 1:15])# remember it is row, column

itemFrequencyPlot(bookbaskets, col = "red", ylab = "Frequency", xlab = "Title", main = "Top Twenty", topN = 20)#plotting the 
```

###Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori Algorithm is the most frequently used Frequency Pattern Analysis(FPA) algorithm. 

The benefit is its scalability for large datasets. Unfortunately, it is computationally intensive.

**Data format requirement**: Horizontal. One column has the transaction ID). Another column has a list of items.

##### You may access the documentation for apriori() in the arules package.

```{r}
#?apriori#check here for default values 
#?arules#see what is in the package here
```
```{r}
#Lots of experimenting!
#bookbasket_reallyUse <- apriori(bookbasket_use, parameter = list(support = 0.0009, 
                                       #confidence = 0.9, minlen = 2, maxlen = 8))
#using support of .0009 and 90% confidence
#print(bookbasket_reallyUse) 

```
## Book Club Recommendations using the Apriori Algorithm

Using Oprah's Book Club list as a guide, we can surmise that book clubs read popular novels. If we look at the top selling novels from the bar chart above, we can use them to see what the buyers of those novels might likely purchase. The ten "rules" are displayed below in no particular order:

```{r}
bookbasket_bookClub = apriori(bookbasket_use, parameter = list(support = 0.00018,confidence = 0.85, minlen = 2, maxlen = 6),
appearance = list(lhs = c( "The Lovely Bones: A Novel", "She's Come Undone", "The Nanny Diaries: A Novel", "A Painted House", "The Secret Life of Bees", "White Oleander : A Novel", "The Deep End of the Ocean","The Red Tent","Where The Heart Is", "House of Sand and Fog"),default="rhs"))
inspect(bookbasket_bookClub)#The rules are not listed in the order of importance. lhs = Left hand side...meaning if they buy on the left side, they will buy what is on the right side.

```

#####According to our analysis, the manager should display the following books targeted to members of book clubs:

**A Map of the World**  
**We Were the Mulvaneys**  
**While I was Gone**  
**The Reader**  
**The Street Lawyer**  
**Girl with the Pearl Earring**  
**Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel**  

###Confidence and Lift

Lift measures "how much more likely an item is to be purchased relative to its typical purchase rate, given that you know another item has been purchased" (Lantz 2013, p. 261).

```{r}
bookbaskets_sorted <-sort(bookbasket_bookClub, by = c("lift", "confidence"))
bookbaskets_rules_df <- as(bookbaskets_sorted, "data.frame")
#View(bookbaskets_rules_df)
```
```{r}
#Writing the rules out to a CSV file:
write(bookbaskets_sorted, file = "C:/Users/cindyHayward/Desktop/ADM/Week_Four/Week4_GIT/Documents/bookbasket_bookClub.csv",
      sep = ",", quote = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
```
###What Other Displays Should be Done?

**Best Sellers**  
We know these sell--so why not put them together?  A selection could look like:

The Lovely Bones: A Novel  
She's Come Undone  
The Nanny Diaries: A Novel  
A Painted House  

**Firsts in the Series**  
The manager knows that the reader of a series will continue to buy in the series.  We also identified that the strongest rules exist in book series.  Given this--why not set up a display of "First in the Series"?  A sampling of what this would look like is below:

One for the Money  
Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone    
The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo
